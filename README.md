Manufacturing Project Repo for ISE 5442 at OU

Added the ability to toss grabbable objects into a trash bin with collision where they will be deleted and a sound effect will play. You can even move the trash bin around!

Robot arm is on the table and can be moved around. 

If you are looking for the house of quality it is in the AR transcription project folder.
